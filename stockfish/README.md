## Network Engine Docker Image

The image sets up Stockfish engine as a network service via xinetd. It downloads the source code from [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) and compiles for *x86-64-modern*. Works with [Droidfish](https://github.com/peterosterlund2/droidfish).
